# Chaarkor's FH6 Trainer

All-in-one trainer for **Forza Horizon 6** — runtime hooks for player profile + live SQL access to the game's in-memory database. Single-file `.exe`, no extra runtime needed.

> ⚠️ **Use at your own risk.** This trainer modifies game memory. Microsoft / Turn 10 can ban your account. **Solo / Free Roam only — never online (Rivals, Eventlab, Multiplayer, leaderboards).**

## ⬇️ Download

Latest release: **[GitHub Releases](../../releases/latest)** — grab `ChaarkorFH6Mod.exe`. Run as administrator (the trainer needs to `OpenProcess` on the game).

## ✅ Working features (FH6 — current build)

### Runtime hooks (Unlocks page)
- 💰 **Credits** — custom value, locked at your number
- 🎰 **Wheelspins** — custom value (unlock first in tutorial)
- ⭐ **Skill Points** — custom value
- 💸 **Sell Payout x** — multiply car sell price

### SQL database actions (Database page)
- 💰 **Free Cars (LOCK)** — BaseCost stays at 0 forever (re-applied every 10s)
- 👁 **Autoshow All Visible (LOCK)** — every car stays in showroom
- ✅ **Install Flags (LOCK)** — IsInstalled / IsPurchased / IsDrivable stay at 1
- 🏷 **Clear NEW Tag** — remove persistent NEW! badges
- 🎁 **Add All Cars** — grant every car free (reopen game to claim)

Each LOCK toggle re-applies its SQL every 10 seconds so the game can't restore the values from save. Backup tables are created automatically before the first lock — flipping the toggle OFF restores originals.

## ⚠️ Broken in current FH6 build (game patched)

These also don't work in Autoshow Unlocker v1.3.0 — Turn 10 changed the underlying functions:
- ❌ Drift Score Multiplier
- ❌ No Skill Break

## 🛡️ Stability

- **CRC bypass** auto-armed before any hook (vtable function pointer swap + 10s re-arm timer)
- **Hook self-healing** — every 10s the engine re-applies any patch the game tries to roll back
- **ExpectedOriginal sanity check** — refuses to inject if the target bytes don't match (no crashes from outdated sigs)
- **Auto-detach** when the game exits / crashes — no writes to dead processes

## 🔧 Build from source

Requires **.NET 10 SDK**, builds on Windows or WSL2 (cross-compile to win-x64):

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true
```

Output: `bin/Release/net10.0-windows/win-x64/publish/ChaarkorFH6Mod.exe`

## 🙏 Credits

This trainer is a UI redesign — I don't write the cheats, I dress them up.

Almost everything that actually does something here is a port of **Forza Horizon 6 - Autoshow Unlocker** by **paris' club** ([discord.gg/WSd3bRNJuJ](https://discord.gg/WSd3bRNJuJ)): every runtime hook (Credits, Wheelspins, Super Wheelspins, Skill Points, Sell Payout), every SQL feature (Free Cars, Autoshow Visible, Install Flags, Add All Cars, Clear NEW Tag), the memory injection foundation, CRC bypass, code caves — all theirs. My contribution is the Avalonia UI shell and a few QoL bits.

Memory scanning powered by **[Reloaded.Memory](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Memory.Sigscan)** — SIMD-accelerated AOB scanner.
